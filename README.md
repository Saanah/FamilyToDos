# FamilyToDos
Mobile Summer Project 2023

# Objectives
The objective was to build a mobile app designed to share and keep track of families' housework or alternatively group work tasks.
The app is supposed to work as an encouragement for families to do housework and share the chores fairly to lessen arguments about whose turn it is to do what.
Users can create an account, create groups, add (family)members, and create and share tasks, which they can keep track of.
An extra objective was to create a point system for every completed chore to keep especially childrens' motivation up.

# Technologies and  architecture
This project was built using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose and Dagger Hilt for frontend and Firebase Firestore for backend.
The project uses MVVM architecture: models, views, viewmodels, and repositories for Firebase Auth and Firestore queries.
